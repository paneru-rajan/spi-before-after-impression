"The few challenges/issues I believe contributing to Open source (OS) project are the following

1. Are the tasks available to the from the OSS structured that is easy to follow for beginners to OSS

2. Are there any coding standards, I've never really expose to a strict coding standard in a project

3. Are the changes I've made have any meaningful impact on the OS project",Agree,Strongly agree,Agree,Neutral,Neutral,Agree,Strongly agree,Agree,Agree,Neutral
"1. review code was written by others

2. collaboration between the different groups that are contributing to the same project

3. understand the code instruction and set-up for the project(learn new technology if I am not familiar with the code) of an open source 

4. fix/refine other people's code, this is particularly difficult when the documentation of the code is vague or the code is not written in an abstract way(i.e. too specific)

5. understand the structure/design of the project on a grander scale

6. optimize the our solution(e.g. consider time complexity, design patterns etc)

7. applying developing method(e.g. agile, waterfall etc) to manage the project

8. maintain communications between the group members

"One of the challenged I believe I will encounter is understanding the community culture. My understanding is that each open source community has its own unique culture and way of working and it is important to understand that culture and follow the project's guidelines and communication channels when making contributions. Although I am aware of this I am worried that as I have never made a contribution to open source code. Secondly, I am worried that I will struggle to find a suitable issue to work on. As open source projects often have a backlog of issues to work on, and not all of them are suitable for new contributors, I understand that finding a suitable issue can be challenging. This will be apparent as I am not familiar with the project's codebase. This means that when selecting an issue to work on I will need to ensure to not over-estimate or under-estimate my ability, especially as I know I am likely to second guess myself and overthink the selection of an issue.",Agree,Strongly agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Neutral

"* Finding suitable project: Whether I have experience working in the language/library needed for project that I am interested in

* Technical skills: Whether my code/contributions will be approved, factors such as code quality, whether I have fully fixed the problem like bugs etc

* Communication: Some contributions are pretty ""big"", meaning that the codebase is very big and complex where individual contribution is almost impossible. Having team work especially with people that you don't meet in person is a major issue in my opinion.

* Contribution progress: Understanding the code written by other people is not an easy job especially when the codebase is very big. For example library like PyTorch (deep learning library) have many dependencies on other libraries, such as NumPy etc, and the code itself might have a function that needs other code and so on and so forth. One function that you want to fix might have code spanning across 3 or more files.

* Rejection: Your contribution might get rejected if it does not fix the issue, not up to their standard or other factors. Sometimes you might spend many days or weeks working on the project and still get rejected after refining for many times. This can serve as a pressure to push yourself to improve your coding skills.

* Keeping up with the changes: A popular open-source project might have many people from all around the world, trying to contribute to it.

As the project is open sourced and potentially already publicly running, pushing code onto the feature branch can come with risks if the code isn’t sound.

Another challenge could be that I might not understand all of the best coding conventions and considerations since I am still early in my coding time and so my contributions to code may not be as helpful or I could create vulnerabilities/bugs without realising it.

I think that another challenge will be that the code base may be confusing. Being a large project, it can be hard to understand the flow of the code and so this may make contributing much more challenging since I will have to figure out how the code works to start with before being able to contribute to it.
